## Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js (mentioned in .npmrc file)  
2. npm (comes with Node.js)  
3. MongoDB installed and running locally (or a remote connection string)  

---

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyankawadle/Movie-Lobby-API.git
   cd movie-lobby-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (see Environment Variables mentioned below).

4. Start MongoDB (locally or ensure your remote MongoDB instance is running).

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development #test or development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/movie-lobby-api
MONGODB_URI_TEST=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/movie-lobby-test

```

- `MONGODB_URI`: Points to your MongoDB connection string for dev enviornment
- `MONGODB_URI_TEST`: Points to your MongoDB connection string  to run test cases
- `PORT`: The port on which your API will run (default `3000`)
- `NODE_ENV`: to run api's use its value as development and to execute test cases use it as test


*(Adjust these values according to your setup.)*

## Running the API

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Typically listens on `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port is specified in your `.env`).

## Running ESLint

The project is configured with **ESLint** to ensure proper code formatting and maintain code quality. Follow the steps below:

1. **Lint the Code**:
   To check for any linting issues, run:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Fix Linting Issues Automatically**:
   To automatically fix linting issues (where possible), run:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

3. **Add ESLint Scripts**:
   Ensure the following scripts are added to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,ts}'",
       "lint:fix": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,ts}' --fix"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Install ESLint**:
   If ESLint is not already installed, run:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
   ```

## Running Test Cases

We have a suite of unit and integration tests using Mocha and Chai.

### 1. Setup Test Environment

Ensure you have a separate test database to prevent affecting your development or production data. update a `.env` varible :

```
NODE_ENV=test
```

### 2. Install Test Dependencies

Ensure the following dev dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mocha chai supertest @types/mocha @types/chai @types/supertest ts-node
```

### 3. Add Test Scripts to `package.json`

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/server.ts",
    "test": "mocha --require ts-node/register 'tests/**/*.test.ts'",
  }
}
```

### 4. Run the Tests

Execute the following command to run all test cases:

```bash
npm test
```

- Output: Mocha will display the results of your test suites, indicating which tests passed or failed.
